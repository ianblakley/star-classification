# Classification of Stellar Objects Using Machine Learning
* This project is meant to use a machine learning model to predict the class of different stellar objects based on several a number of features such as the object's redshift, ultraviolet, and green/red/infrared filter values.
* I elected to use the RandomForest model for this task as it is particularly effective at classification.
* The model was very successful with a 97.86% accuracy.
* This model can be deployed in the future to expedite the process of classifying newly discovered celestial objects.
* Dataset was found here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17)
